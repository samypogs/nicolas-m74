**UNIT DESKS**

**Best Suited**

These six work units will function as desk workspace designed for artists whose practice consists of smaller more intimate works.   Possibly best suited for younger artists (26-30) who are looking to develop their practice with a co-working environment.  The space will be equipped with a large shared bathroom, a shared communal storage space and an outdoor patio.  A kitchen could slowly be developed for the artists but this will evolve naturally. \*\*\*\*
