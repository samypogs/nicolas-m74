**Best Suited** 

The studio is part of a dynamic array of artists specializing in sculpture, the large space is ideal for a workshop style practice as the hard-wearing floor allows the artist to develop their practice without the standard limitation of a traditional space.  It was developed as a machine room, for quick assembly of components that could then be assembled at its adjacent gallery as it is connected by two large double doors.  On the other end of the studio there is a sliding door, whose aim is to allow large heavy material to be easily introduced into the space.
