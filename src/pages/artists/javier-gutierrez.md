**Alvaro Ugarte**(Guadalajara, Mexico, 1984)is a sculptor who lives and works in Mexico City.Most of Ugarte´s artistic practice begins as a social experience by staging scenarios or situations to function as devices of engagement between members of a given community. Consequently, the material outcomes, which are often unpredictable due to the nature of the actions and its collective dimensions; may take the form of sculptures, installations, or any other documentary record.\
Moreover, his background in Social Science Communication, has undoubtedly shaped his artistic practice by given him the tools in how Ugarte relates to art —from its social implications to the methodologies applied in his researches.\
More recently, Ugarte has expanded his field of study on analyzing mental structures and social behaviors. Where, through seemingly absurd procedures such as the act of sleeping, espionage and the use of esoteric query, tries to question how the mind function within specific social contexts.
