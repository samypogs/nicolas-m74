**Enrique Polanco** is a sculptor born in Venezuela currently working in Mexico City.  His work translates an interest in using a neo-praxis experimental system of the daily manual work.  His practice is an exploration of materials of the cosmos, and of the spacial-temporal dimension. He works mainly with ceramics, gesso, bronze, concrete, wood and drawing.
