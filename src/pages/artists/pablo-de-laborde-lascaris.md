**Pablo de Laborde Lascaris** is a Mexican Sculptor based between the United Kingdom and Mexico City. It is through the orchestration of specific dialogues between two entities that Pablo’s work challenges the functionality of day-to-day objects. He does so by creating artifacts that either suggest a reinterpreted use, or objects that are made obsolete by the alteration of their shape, scale or material. His deliberate act of depriving an item of its actual purpose questions the traditional qualities of sculpture by destabilizing them within their historical contexts.
